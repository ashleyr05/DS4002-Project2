## Instructions for Reproducing Results

To reproduce the results of our project:

1) Clone this repository from GitHub
2) Open this repository in Visual Studio Code
3) Install Python and Jupyter in Visual Studio Code
4) If you wish to get final_data.csv on your own, download agriculture_workers_percent_of_employment.csv, child_mortality_0_5_year_olds_dying_per_1000_born.csv, children_per_woman_total_fertility.csv, exports_percent_of_gdp.csv, gdp_total_yearly_growth.csv, industry_workers_percent_of_employment.csv, lex.csv, owid_education_idx.csv, and service_workers_percent_of_employment.csv and run data_cleaning.ipynb
5) Run Corr Charts.ipynb to get correlation charts of the variables segmented by developed and developing nations
6) View PivotCharts.XLSX in SCRIPTS to get the excel file and pivot tables used to create 2 of the graphs used in presentation
